# Challenge10-SVG-Logo-Maker


## Description

This project is a SVG Logo Maker that utilizes the command-line application. It also uses the NPM Inquirer package and its required dependencies. This application will receive user input to generate the logo as a 'logo.svg' file. 

The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a .svg file.

The motivation for this project was to apply the inquirer node module to create markdown file through the command-line application, in this case a README.md file. For this project I took on the user story: "AS A developer I WANT a README generator SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project." As stated in this challenge's direction, "This allows the project creator to devote more time working on the project," such that the README can save time by being created in the command line.

This project was built as a tool to diminish the time it takes for a developer to create a README file, so that they can spend more time working on the actual project. This solves the problem for developers who need to create a README more efficiently in their workflow.

By creating this project, I learned how to explore and utilize the Node Package Manager (NPM) Inquirer package, the module.exports method in exporting a file and the require method for including packages needed for an application. Additionally I learned how to write files from JavaScript using the 'fs' package.
